		<h2>Features</h2>
		<p>This package stops themes from installing Snowboard, this is very useful if a theme has Anemone as a dependency but you want to use your engine of choice.</p>
		<h2>Known issues</h2>
		<li>This package will seriously break Snowboard! It's also not needed as it's meant to fix an issue with <i>Anemone</i> and not with Snowboard.</li>
		<li>This package may conflict with iThemer, I reached out to DODGraphics about this!</li>
